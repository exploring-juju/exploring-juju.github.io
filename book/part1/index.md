Juju, as a tool, helps abstract a lot of the ideas about cloud deployments out
into concepts that are easily understood and easily explained.  To that end,
this part of the book will explain the process of working with Juju through the
process one would take in deploying a new cloud service.  For that, we will be
deploying a scalable Ghost blog that will be used for our fictional company's
press releases and corporate communications.
