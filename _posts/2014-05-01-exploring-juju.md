title: Exploring Juju

---

> Canonical Juju sprint, Las Vegas, NV.

I've been working on the Juju project for more than a year and a half by now,
and I'm still learning a ton of new things.  In fact, today was the first day I
got a charm that I helped write up and running!  I've worked on charms before -
I helped work on the Juju GUI charm which has been nice and solid for more than
a year now.  However, the process that I've gone through in writing the Ghost
charm has helped expose me and my co-charmers to much more of the internals and
workings of Juju than we've dealt with in the past, and that's been
enlightening.

There are lots of docs for Juju out there.  The Juju command-line tool is full
of them, [the docs site](http://juju.ubuntu.com/docs) has loads, and the
resources available through social interaction are immense.  However, I felt
that the path of working with juju, from bootstrap to production, charm
authoring to charm publishing, was missing.  There's a story in everything we
do, and no one had yet set down the story of working with Juju.

To that end, I've started this book project, *Exploring Juju*.  *Exploring Juju*
is an open-source story, welcoming contributions from community members and
updates from Canonicalites working on the project.  The goal is to provide the
story and best-practices of working with such a powerful dev-ops tool.

Dive in and check out Juju, dev-ops distilled.
